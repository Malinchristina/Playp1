            <h2>About Me, Breathwork & Yoga</h2>
            <div id="p1-about">
                <p>I remember my first encounter with yoga back in early 2000. I was reading about some movements in a health magazine that
                was called yoga and I tried to do them on the rug in my living room. Little did I know then what part yoga would play in
                my life.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Fast forward 15 years and I was practising yoga on a regular basis but I kind of didn't feel it in my soul, I wasn't
                connected to it. Then life happened, and found myself turning more and more to yoga and after an exceptionally
                challenging period I went to my first retreat. It happened to be where I found breathwork. A modality that really
                changed me to the core. I faced and conquered my absolute worst phobia, I cleansed my soul and released feelings and
                tensions that had been stored for years, and I connected to yoga in a way I didn't know existed.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="p2-about">
                <p>Breathwork has allowed me to connect to my body and soul, deepened my understanding of myself and allowed to forgive
                what needed to be forgiven. Yoga has made me more aware of both my physical and mental being. It helped and still helps me to heal from a lumbar
                fusion surgery I had in January 2022. I'm proud of the person that both these modalities has helped, and still helps me to become.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Since spring 2020 I'm a certified breathwork facilitator 400h via Alchemy Of Breath and November 2022 I got my 200h yoga
                teacher certificate via True North Vinyasa. But I'm not just about breathwork and yoga. I love the forest, and the mountains. I love to bike, hike, ski, eat and
                drink tasty stuff, spend time with family, friends and tribe.</p>
